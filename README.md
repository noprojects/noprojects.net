~ This website is not developed with mobile in mind, and probably never will.

~ As of the creation of this readme file, the website is in it's very early stages of development.

~ For now, the name of the website is completely accurate and nobody actually has any projects.

~ I know going to a website like noprojects.net/vito/vito is really silly looking, but while the website is in development I enjoy having all my 
code for one part of the website in one folder. In the domain, the first 'vito' in 'vito/vito' is the name of the folder.

### Websites domain is: www.noprojects.net 

### Thanks for reading.
