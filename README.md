### Before posting an issue, please take a look at the answers to common questions below, and if they don't answer your questions, then look at past issues and their answers.

~ The website isn't made for mobile, and probably never will.

~ As of writing this message, the website isn't finished, and probably not for a while.

~ Nobody here actually has any projects to be put in the website as of now,
  but we are thinking of creating a group project soon.

~ This website was bought from NameCheap

~ If you would like to learn more about the website, or get news about updates, please join the Discord.
  If you want EARLY ACCESS SHIT (LIKE WHILE THE WEBSITE IS BEING MADE) join the Patreon. Please don't
  join the Patreon just because you have money. (Lookin at you peebox.)

~ I know a domain that looks like noprojects.net/vito/vito is really silly, but the first 'vito' is literally
  a folder lmao. I'll move everything from the folders and into the main directory once I'm done with the site,
  so that it looks like noprojects.net/vito

### Website main domain is www.noprojects.net (finding out how to add https soon lmao)

### Thanks for reading
